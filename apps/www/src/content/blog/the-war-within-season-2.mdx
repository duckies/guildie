In order to (attempt to) prepare our team for the 11.1 patch and the new season I have collected the CliffsNotesâ„¢ for what is going away and what is different compared to season one. This post only covers the how when it comes to things like mythic+ gearing, not our guild's expectations, which will be covered elsewhere.

## Release Schedule

The War Within Patch 11.1: Undermine(d) releases on February 25th, but Season 2 and instanced content is set to release on March 4th.

| Date | Week | Content |
| --- | :---: | --- |
| February 25 | 0 | Patch 11.1 is released, but with season 1 raids and dungeons. |
| March 4 | 1 | Mythic+, Raid Finder Wing 1, Normal, Heroic and Mythic difficulty raid |
| March 11 | 2 | Raid Finder Wing 2 and Story Mode |
| March 18 | 3 | Raid Finder Wing 3 |
| March 25 | 4 | Raid Finder Wing 4 |

## What's going away?
I won't include things that were naturally obtained by raiding and gearing in Mythic+.

- [Cutting Edge: Queen Ansurek](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=40254/cutting-edge-queen-ansurek) is going away, but she will continue to drop two [Reins of the Ascendant Skyrazor](https://www.wowhead.com/item=224151/reins-of-the-ascendant-skyrazor) per kill until the end of the expansion. We'll likely revisit her during periods of insanity.
- [Tempered Hero: The War Within Season 1](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=20589/tempered-hero-the-war-within-season-1) from being in the top 0.1% of all Mythic+ ratings for the region. 
- The Keystone Hero achievements which award the ability to teleport to any dungeon that you've completed at a +10 or higher within the time limit.
- The varied "*-The War Within Season 1" PvP achievements, with ratings locking at 10:00 pm local time (?) the night before the patch.
- Delves have seasonal achievements for doing up to and including a Tier 11 delve, rewarding the "High Explorer" title. The achievement [I TAKE CANDLE](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=40446/i-take-candle), and the three achievements for killing Zekvir, [Nemesis](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=40103/nemesis) (rewarding [Zekvir's Raptorial Spine](https://www.wowhead.com/item=212171/zekvirs-raptorial-spine)), [Hunting the Hunter](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=40431/hunting-the-hunter) (rewarding the "Ascension Breaker" title), and [Let me Solo Him](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=40433/let-me-solo-him) (rewarding the dirigible mount transformation [Delver's Dirigible Schematic: Void](https://www.wowhead.com/item=225542/delvers-dirigible-schematic-void)) will become unobtainble. The only exception being [Zekvir's Raptorial Spine](https://www.wowhead.com/item=212171/zekvirs-raptorial-spine), which will be obtainable as a rare drop from Zekvir going forward.
- Plunderstorm will be ending and with it, access to the piratey [rewards](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/plunderstorm-renown-event-rewards). It's relatively easy to get 1-2 thousand plunder per round if you only want a few select items.
- The [Algari Dungeoneer](https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=40138/algari-dungeoneer) achievement, which rewards a frigheningly awful transmog set, requires you to do every The War Within dungeon on Mythic as each specialization. You are only able to complete half of the achievement this season via The Dawnbreaker, City of Threads, The Stonevault, and Ara-Kara, City of Threads. In season 2 these dungeons will lose their mythic difficulty until they are back in rotation or the expansion ends.
    > If you are actually interested in doing this, credit is counted via whatever specialization you are as you kill the last boss.

## Undermine Zone

The new zone is accesible starting with a quest chain beginning with [Renzik "The Shiv"](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/npc=225571/renzik-the-shiv) in the Foundation Hall in Dornogol (where the Stormwind and Orgrimmar portals are) on February 25th. Make sure to talk to [Rustol](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/npc=235402/rustol) when you reach Undermine unlock the ability to teleport between Undermine and Dornogol.

### What can I do in Undermine?

> Aside from the new Vantus Rune recipe for inscriptionists and the Armor Kit recipe for leatherworkers purchasable at Renown 5, the rest of the zone is only useful for collecting Valorstones and cosmetics. 

- You can't fly in the subterranean city of Undermine, so unless you want to walk everywhere you will want to unlock your [G-99 Breakneck](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=460013/g-99-breakneck) from the campaign. This mount uses the new D.R.I.V.E. system that has racecar-meets-Mario-Kart mechanics, but is only useable in Undermine. You can use [Boost](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/spell=471755/boost) to speed up using the Turbo resource above your car. If you hold down spacebar you will start drifting, allowing you to restore Turbo but only while turning. Running over Kaja'Cola cans also restores some Turbo.
- Embrace the Goblininomenon by farming reputation with the new Undermine factions under The Cartels of Undermine umbrella. The immediate rewards for daily content are still [Valorstones](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/currency=3008/valorstones) and the renown [rewards](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/the-war-within/patch-11-1-cartels-of-undermine-renown-guide#renown-rewards) cosmetic. Renown level 5 has some important profession recipes.

  | Recipe | Item |

  |  [Technique: Vantus Rune: Liberation of Undermine](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=233022/technique-vantus-rune-liberation-of-undermine) | [Vantus Rune: Liberation of Undermine](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=232937/vantus-rune-liberation-of-undermine) |
  | [Schematic: 22H Slicks](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=234274/schematic-22h-slicks) | [22H Slicks](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=232985/22h-slicks) |
  | [Pattern: Charged Armor Kit](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=235338/pattern-charged-armor-kit) | [Charged Armor Kit](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=235336/charged-armor-kit) |

- Once the season starts you can kill the world boss, [The Gobfather](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/npc=231821/the-gobfather). He drops ilvl 642 Champion 3/8 gear.
- Kill rares for Valorstones or to collect their ilvl 600 warbound gear for alts.
- Visit C.H.E.T.T. on the second floor of the Incontinental Hotel ðŸ’© in Undermine to obtain a [C.H.E.T.T. List](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=236682/c-h-e-t-t-list) that you can right-click in your inventory to view a list of 8 weekly tasks. Each task gives 10 Valorstones upon completion and completing 4 turns the item into a [Completed C.H.E.T.T. List](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/item=235053/completed-c-h-e-t-t-list). You can turn this item in to C.H.E.T.T. for 250 Valorstones or to one of the cartel quartermasters for 500 reputation.

- At Renown 3 you can dig for scrap as small events found by their trashcan icons on the map. It gives Valorstones and cosmetic rewards.

## Mythic+ Season 2

### Dungeon Rotation

The new dungeon rotation includes the remaining four expansion dungeons, Operation: Floodgate, a new dungeon at the Waterworks dam, and three returning dungeons.

- Cinderbrew Meadery

### Rewards

Blizzard has updated the reward structure in Season 2 to make lower key levels more rewarding with a +6 being the threshold for Hero track end-of-dungeon loot (was +7) with Gilded crests rewarded at +7 and higher (was +8). The maximal reward for both end-of-dungeon and Great Vault is still a +10 with the bonus of giving Hero 3/6 gear at the end of the dungeon (was Hero 2/6).

> Â¹Depleting a keystone gives 4 less than the amount of crests for a timed run, carrying over from the 11.0.7 changes.

### Scaling

Dungeons have had their scaling decreased in Season 2.

| Keystone | S2 Modifier | S1 Modifier |
| :---: | --- | --- |
| 2 | +7% | +10% |
| 3 | +14% | +21% |
| 4 | +23% | +33% |
| 5 | +31% | +46% |
| 6 | +40% | +61% |
| 7 | +50% | +77% |
| 8 | +61% | +95% |
| 9 | +72% | +114% |
| 10 | +84% | +136% |
| 11 | +102% | +159% |
| 12 | +122% | +185% |
| 13 | +132% | +214% |
| 14 | +142% | +245% |
| 15 | +152% | +280% | 

### Affixes

| Threshold | Affix |
| :---: | --- |
| 4+ | Xal'atath's Bargain ([Ascendant](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/affix=148/xalataths-bargain-ascendant), [Voidbound](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/affix=158/xalataths-bargain-voidbound), <span className="inline-flex items-center gap-1 text-red-300 [&>a]:text-inherit">[Oblivion](https://www.wowhead.com/affix=159/xalataths-bargain-oblivion) <LucideChevronsDown className="h-4 w-4" /></span>, <span className="inline-flex items-center gap-1 text-green-300 [&>a]:text-inherit">[Pulsar](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/affix=162/xalataths-bargain-pulsar) <LucideChevronsUp className="h-4 w-4" /></span>, [Devour](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/affix=160/xalataths-bargain-devour))  |
| 7+ | [Tyrannical](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/affix=9/tyrannical) or [Fortified](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/affix=10/fortified) (weekly rotating) |
| 10+ | [Tyrannical](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/affix=9/tyrannical) **and** [Fortified](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/affix=10/fortified) |
| 12+ | [Xal'atath's Guile](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/affix=147/xalataths-guile) |

The Xal'atath's Bargain affixes are returning with the exception of [Oblivion](https://www.wowhead.com/affix=159/xalataths-bargain-oblivion), the affix where you had to soak orbs before they reached mobs. It is succeeded by a redesigned orb soaking affix, [Pulsar](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/affix=162/xalataths-bargain-pulsar). This new affix has orbs that tether themselves to each player and orbit them for 30 seconds that need to be soaked. Soaking them gives Mastery and Leech, but if not soaked mobs gain +10% damage and 20% damage reduction per orb.

Blizzard has also redesigned the level 12 affix, [Xal'atath's Guile](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/affix=147/xalataths-guile), to be what [Challenger's Peril](https://www.wowhead.com/ptr-2/affix=152/challengers-peril) was â€” removing 15 seconds from the timer per death while also still rescinding the bargains.

### Seasonal Rewards
