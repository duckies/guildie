The first phase revolves around space management and being consistent with the bombs. In your own personal preparation be weary of pre-nerf materials, as phase one changes were significant.

## Mechanics

These are the mechanics that are changed or worth commenting on in mythic.

### Phase 1 Mechanics

<Mechanic id="437592" name="Reactive Toxin" caption="Sets 2 and 3 spawn 3 bombs instead of 2.">
The major change to Phase 1, the 2nd and 3rd set of Reactive Toxin goes out 3 players, spawning 3 [Reactive Froth](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=438846) bombs instead of 2. Be weary of looking at old preparation materials for this fight as the third set used to have 4 bombs (2-3-4), post-nerf it’s 2-3-3.
</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id="460133" name="Toxic Reaction" caption="Bomb popping must be staggered.">
When a [Reactive Froth](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=438846) bomb is popped everyone is given a 2000% vulnerability to this mechanic for 1 second, requiring bomb popping to be staggered. 
</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id="439814" name="Silken Tomb" caption="Roots need to be cleared as fast as possible.">

The roots are mechanically the same as on heroic. However, most mechanics in phase one happen every 5 seconds, and often with sensitive positioning urging us to clear them as fast as possible. Players will self-clear wherever possible and things like Master’s Call will be assigned to help those in need. A small number of roots will need to be cleaved down each set (they have 18 million health).

There is utility in <Monk>Monks</Monk>, <Paladin>Holy Paladins</Paladin>, <Priest>Priest</Priest>, and <Rogue>Rogues</Rogue> being Gnomes so they can self-clear with the [Escape Artist](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=20589/escape-artist) racial. This gives Priests and Rogues more self-clearing capabilities, whereas Holy Paladins and Monks can use their racial to self clear then Freedom or Tiger’s Lust someone else.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2">
  <div>
    Those who cannot always clear themselves:

    - **<DemonHunter/>** can use their pre-meta jump to immune the root, however it’s not worth messing up their cd timings. It’s common for DHs to be under the boss to cleave away their root every set.
    - **<Priest>Priests</Priest>**
        - **Holy** needs help every time.
        - **Discipline** is currently a dead spec.
        - **Shadow** can disperse one, or two with a talent. However, this talent is on a choice node with [Mental Fortitude](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=194018/mental-fortitude) and shouldn’t be taken unless strictly necessary.
    - **<Evoker>Augmentation Evoker</Evoker>**
    Can only clear themselves once.
    - **<Rogue>Rogues</Rogue>** will need help on one of the roots unless taking double vanish, which is a decent DPS loss depending on the spec.
  </div>
  <div>

    | Iteration | Timing |
    | --- | --- |
| Silken Tomb 1	| 0:16  |
| Silken Tomb 2	| 0:56 (+40 Seconds) |
| Silken Tomb 3	| 1:50 (+54 Seconds) |

    The only class which requires Time Spiral is <Shaman>Shamans</Shaman> [Spirit Walk](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=58875/spirit-walk) is a 1 minute cooldown), therefore the only necessary Time Spiral is on Silken Tomb 2.

    #### The fuck does Time Spiral do?
    
    [Time Spiral](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=374968/time-spiral) is a 2-minute evoker talent that does the following when cast for 10 seconds:
    
    - Allows everyone within 40 yards to use their “major movement ability” even if it is on cooldown.
    - Using one’s “major movement ability” in this window will not incur a cooldown.

### Intermission Mechanics

<Mechanic id="447170" name="Predation Threads" caption="Tiny aoe damage around players.">

Players will take 402k nature damage every 1.5 seconds to players within 2 yards. This was a mechanic on heroic and it still does not do a lot of damage. It's safe to run through players to reposition for [Wrest](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=447411/wrest), but otherwise loosely spread to the best of your ability.

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id="441958" name="Grasping Silk" caption="Move ahead of growing miasma.">

Throughout the duration of the phase the [Grasping Silk](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=441958/grasping-silk) miasma left behind in the previous phase will grow. In addition, each [Wrest](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=447411/wrest) will also spawn more [Grasping Silk](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=441958/grasping-silk) miasma which also grows.

Stay ahead of the miasma but also make sure to be ahead of any incoming [Paralyzing Waves](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=451607/paralyzing-waves), which will kill you.

</Mechanic>

### Phase 2 Mechanics

<Mechanic id="464056" name="Gloom Touch" caption="The bad touch, the good touch?">

This is a magic-dispellable debuff that we've seen in heroic from the Devoted Worshippers, aka the shielded mobs on the 2nd phase 2 platform. It deals mild, 575k shadow damage every 1.5 seconds for 12 seconds, now also cleaving this damage to anyone within 8 yards in mythic.

Expiration or removal of the debuff deals 2 million damage to players on the platform of the dispellee via [Gloom Blast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=447983/gloom-blast) and leaves a moderately sized [Gloom](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=443403/gloom) miasma puddle on the ground.

The Devoted Worshippers still cast this ability on one random healer per side shortly after reaching the second phase 2 platform, but players who step through a [Shadowgate](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=460366/shadowgate) are also afflicted with this debuff.

<Callout type="info">

The Gloom Touch applied by Shadowgates have an id of `464056` whereas the Gloom Touch applied by Devoted Worshippers have an id of `447967`. The mechanics are identical in every way aside from the means of application, and their id.

</Callout>

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id="460366" name="Shadowgate" caption="A player in each group periodically swaps platforms.">

In Mythic, the adds that share health across platforms via [Echoing Connection](<https://www.wowhead.com/spell=462692/echoing-connection>) will emerge from a Shadowgate on each platform. The gates themselves spam a 12 second cast of the same name, [Shadowgate](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=460369/shadowgate), that will kill their side of the room if it goes off. This cast can be reset by stepping into them, teleporting the player to the opposite platform's Shadowgate, but afflicting the player with two debuffs:

- [Gloom Touch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=464056/gloom-touch), which is described above this mechanic; deals raid damage and drops miasma when dispelled.
- [Shadowy Distortion](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=460218/shadowy-distortion) prevents the player from re-entering a Shadowgate for 30 seconds. 

When we clear a platform the Shadowgate will jump to the next platform and spawn the next set of adds. Importantly, when a Shadowgate jumps it will reset its cast timer, though it will start casting immediately on the new platform even before we get there. Lastly, killing the final add of phase 2, the lone Ascended Voidspeaker, will destroy the Shadowgates as well as any active [Gloom Touch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=464056/gloom-touch) debuffs.

</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id="447950" name="Ascended Voidspeaker" caption="Phase 2 starting adds that need kicked.">

The Ascended Voidspeakers are the adds with shared health that spawn when we enter phase 2, and as the final mob of phase 2, which knock us up to the platforms as they die. They have the same, simple heroic mechanics scaled to lethal levels.

- [Shadowblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=447950/shadowblast) is a 4-second cast that will kill whoever it is cast on. We will be using the interrupt anchor WeakAura to orchestrate a kick order.
- [Radiating Gloom](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=447999/radiating-gloom) is periodic rot damage within 45 yards of the Voidspeaker. They also spawn a void zone under a random ranged that shoot [Gloom Orbs](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=448176/gloom-orbs) from it. The void zone and orbs will probably kill anyone hit.


</Mechanic>

## Phase 1 • A Queen's Venom
The [Phase 1 RaidPlan](https://raidplan.io/plan/X4iPdCthlYOmlR5R) has been rotated so that it lines up with how movement is seen in log replays. The biggest concerns of this phase are being out of position for the fast-paced mechanics.

    <TabsContent value="part1">
      <Image src={img_ansurek_mp1_1} alt="Phase 1 Part 1" />

      The fight is started with the boss brought to the tip immediately to the right if you were running onto the platform. Everyone will stack on her to keep acid pools as close together as possible, just as on heroic.
    </TabsContent>
    <TabsContent value="part2">
      <Image src={img_ansurek_mp1_2} alt="Phase 1 Part 2" />

      Roots are placed as closely as possible to any preceding acid, but avoid crossing into the trapezoid on the other side of the red line as we want to keep this area clean for the intermission.

      - If you have assigned utility like Freedom, Tiger’s Lust, or Master’s Call on another player, their raid frame will glow thanks to the MRT note.
      - Tanks or those with immunities can dip into the acid before removing their root to save space.

      During [Web Blades](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=439299/web-blades) melee will stack with the active tank in front of the boss near the edge and ranged loosely spread on the other side of the boss.

      - The [Web Blades](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=439299/web-blades) will spawn every 0.5 seconds until 3 are spawned, after which there is a 1-second delay before they erupt every 0.5 seconds in the same order they spawned in.
      - Everyone will refer to the WeakAura on their screen and wait to move until the last blade spawns (the last green tick), or at the least stagger movement as a cohesive unit. We want to avoid someone running 20 yards ahead of the group and cutting everyone off if they are targeted.

    </TabsContent>
    <TabsContent value="part4">
      <Image src={img_ansurek_mp1_4} alt="Phase 1 Part 4" />

      The first set of [Reactive Toxin](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=437592/reactive-toxin) goes out on 2 players and spawns 2 [Reactive Froth](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=438846) bombs.

      - A WeakAura will assign players with [Reactive Toxin](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=437592/reactive-toxin) to spawn their bomb on <Star /> (stack 1) or <Circle /> (stack 2). Consider the following when placing these bombs:
      - There will not be world markers for this set.
      - There must be enough room between these bomb circles for the raid to stack between.
      - The bombs can partially overlap the web miasma to save space. If the boss is too close the melee popper can go a half-second early.
    </TabsContent>
    <TabsContent value="part5">
      <Image src={img_ansurek_mp1_5} alt="Phase 1 Part 5" />

      If the <Star /> and <Circle /> markers are placed correctly there will be a cubbie between the two. If there isn't, the raid can stack just outside of their intersection.
    </TabsContent>
    <TabsContent value="part6">
      <Image src={img_ansurek_mp1_6} alt="Phase 1 Part 6" />

      If necessary, you can cheat into the middle of the room. Only cheat ahead if it prevents you from being killed. Remember, immunities (that don't prevent you from dropping webs) should be used during webs so that you may dip into the acid and save room for the rest of the group.
    </TabsContent>
    <TabsContent value="part7">
      <Image src={img_ansurek_mp1_7} alt="Phase 1 Part 7" />

      This starts a sequence of 2 back-to-back [Web Blades](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=439299/web-blades). This image depicts the first blades, and nothing about them is different from the first time we've done them. Reminder of web blade mechanics:
      - Melee are in front of the boss with the tanks.
      - Ranged are loosely spread opposite of the melee group, behind the boss.
      - Don't move until the WeakAura shows the third blade has spawned.
      - Dodge in the same direction as your group. Otherwise, you can be out of position for the next mechanic.

      However, once we finish dodging everyone should remain in position to bait the next set of [Web Blades](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=439299/web-blades) away from where we just came from.
    </TabsContent>
    <TabsContent value="part8">
      <Image src={img_ansurek_mp1_8} alt="Phase 1 Part 8" />

      After the first [Web Blades](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=439299/web-blades) are spawned, and we've waited where we've dodged to, we will spawn a second set. We dodge these [Web Blades](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=439299/web-blades) by still listening to the WeakAura, but back towards the wall of web miasma.

      As we are running back, the boss will spawn the 2nd set of [Reactive Toxin](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=437592/reactive-toxin) debuffs. 
    </TabsContent>
    <TabsContent value="part9">
      <Image src={img_ansurek_mp1_9} alt="Phase 1 Part 9" />

      The second set of [Reactive Toxin](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=437592/reactive-toxin) goes on 3 players instead of 2. To deal with this we will place them in a line with the radius of each debuff touching the miasma from the webs.
      > Unlike the first set, sets of 3 toxin debuffs do not need to have a space between them.
    
      The <Diamond/> popper needs to be careful to follow the `DON'T POP` WeakAura, not the assignment WeakAura as that is an estimate. The <Diamond/> popper must always pop the moment the vulnerability falls off from <Circle/>.

      <Image src={img_ansurek_mp1_10} alt="Phase 1 Part 10" />

      This is the *difficult* dance of the phase. The following happens in quick succession:
      
      1. `1:35` — (Prior Slide) The [Reactive Froth](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=438846) bombs have finished exploding.
      2. `1:38` — [Web Blades](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=439299/web-blades) spawn. Since we have too little time to reconvene back at the bomb miasma, we instead dodge towards the opposite side of this platform section.
      3. `1:40` — The moment we can dodge the blades coincides with [Liquefy](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=436799/liquefy) puddles. So the ranged and melee groups should move into a safe position after the third blade spawns, then stack together for Liquefy.

      Some level of mess is acceptable here in the name of safety, but avoid crossing into the next section of room. You may cheat into the middle of the room, or behind us, if you wish.

    <TabsContent value="part11">
      <Image src={img_ansurek_mp1_11} alt="Phase 1 Part 11" />
      After a short break from the previous mechanic set we have [Silken Tomb](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=439814/silken-tomb) roots. Then, as we're dodging with our melee and ranged groups, we get [Web Blades](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=439299/web-blades). We dodge towards the next secton of the room.
    </TabsContent>
    <TabsContent value="part12">
      <Image src={img_ansurek_mp1_12} alt="Phase 1 Part 12" />
      The last overlap of the phase is [Web Blades](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=439299/web-blades) at `2:20` followed by the [Reactive Froth](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=438846) bomb-popping sequence starting at `2:23`. This is most difficult for the <Star/> group, but other players should be trying to dodge these blades towards their assigned bomb positions.

## Intermission: The Spider's Web

There isn't anything too special about the intermission, but it's easy to get killed by the waves if you're not careful. Repetition will help everyone get used to the positioning.

The goal of the intermission is to break her shield before she casts [Wrest](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=447411/wrest) for the third time. For the duration of the intermission all previous [Grasping Silk](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=441958/grasping-silk) miasma spawned by roots, as well as [Grasping Silk](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=441958/grasping-silk) now spawned by each [Wrest](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=447411/wrest) in mythic, will grow in size.

      The intermission starts with a [Wrest](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=447411/wrest). Fit as tightly against the acid as possible, even dipping in if you have a strong enough personal. Eveyone should stay ahead of the red line so that melee have more room to spread after.

      The second wrest is the most dangeorus part of the intermission, but should come easily with comfort. She stops casting waves during the 6-second [Wrest](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=447411/wrest) cast, so when you see your WeakAura popup for the cast position yourself between the most recent waves. There is another red line we do not cross; we want prevent webs from taking all of the melee space.

      It's easy for players to misjudge their position with encroaching web pools and waves. When in doubt, you want to be on the left side of a wave before you're gripped.

## Phase 2 • Royal Ascension

The second phase starts when we break her intermission shield. Specifically, we have to break her [Predation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=447076/predation) shield before she finishes casting [Wrest](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=447411/wrest) for the third time which starts at `3:18` and finishes (wipes us) at `3:24`.

<Callout type="info">

We are meant to push to phase 2 **during** the last cast of [Wrest](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=447411/wrest) for twoish reasons:

1. We want as many cooldowns available, consistently, for phase 2. Phase 2 has the biggest damage and push time requirements. 
2. 99% of the time the first [Wrest](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=450191/wrest) cast in phase 2 will be on the ranged side. However, there is a theory debated in the Raid Leader Exchange that if we break Ansurek's shield before she starts her third [Wrest](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=447411/wrest) cast, the platform she picks for the first phase 2 wrest will not be consistent. 

</Callout>

### Platform 0 • Pre-Jump

<Image src={img_ansurek_mp2_sides} alt="Phase 2 Sides" />


As we enter the second phase the raid will split and deal with the Ascended Voidspeaker spawning in front of their assigned sides. You may see the following nomenclature throughout the known cosmos for the sides:

- **Melee, Left, Close, or North**: Northermost on the minimap, or to the left of our position post-intermission facing Ansurek.
- **Ranged, Right, Far, or South**: Southermost on the minimap, or to the right of our position post-intermission facing Ansurek.

<Callout type="info">

The Northern Sky WeakAuras use `Left` and `Right` nomenclature, but this is not important. For example, if a WeakAura says `Gate → Right`, there is only one gateway you can take and it's on the platform you're already on — all you must know is it wants you to use the Shadowgate. I much prefer calling them the melee and ranged platforms, so I'll be referring to them as such. Whatever reason you think this preference is wrong will only make me think less of you, so keep it to yourself.

</Callout>

The goal of this first part of phase 2 is not to kill these Voidspeakers as fast as possible, so no cooldowns, but we also won't be holding damage. We just want to safely deal with the following abilities:

- <HeroicBadge/> [Shadowblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=447950/shadowblast) is a 4-second interruptable cast from the Voidspeakers that deals a demure 💅 57 million shadow damage to their target if not kicked. We will use the [Interrupt Anchor](https://wago.io/InterruptAnchor) WeakAura to assign a kick order for this ability.
- <HeroicBadge/> [Radiating Gloom](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=447999/radiating-gloom) does rot damage to the raid and periodically picks a random ranged with a circle that shoots [Gloom Orbs](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=448176/gloom-orbs) from it. The circle and the orbs deal lethal amounts of damage.
- <MythicBadge/> [Shadowgates](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=460369/shadowgate) are thoroughly explained in [phase 2 mechanics](#phase-2-mechanics). While we remain on the phase 1 platform, we will treat these first Shadowgates as a special case.

The first Shadowgates we will assign a pair of healers to swap sides. These healers will need to wait for the Shadowgate cast to be near its end. Swapping 3 seconds before the cast finishes will suffice. These healers can then dispel themselves immediately, right on top of the Shadowgate, or slightly to the side, it doesn't matter.

The tanks will keep the Voidspeakers directly in line with the Shadowgate, only moving it forward a few yards if needed to avoid the [Gloom](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=443403/gloom) miasma from the debuff.

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-[1fr_auto] gap-2 my-6">
  <div>
    The Shadowgate assignments take the form of a pair of bars for each Shadowgate cast bar. It then assigns a valid, or the next alive and non-debuffed, player on the list for that side to go next. Clearing a platform will reset the castbar, but the assignment will stay the same until that person uses the Shadowgate. The player assigned will also see text in the middle of their screen for the duration of the cast in the form of `GATE -> RIGHT` or `GATE -> LEFT`.

    The `Left` and `Right` is saying this person is going **to** that side, e.g. in the picture Waysoone is on the left, melee side, and is being sent to the right, ranged side. This text isn't important, just know you are next for the Shadowgate if you see `GATE` in the middle of your screen.

### Platform 1 • Wrests 1 & 3

The following slides are for the team that gets the first [Wrest](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=450191/wrest) on the first phase 2 platform. This should be the ranged platform, but for reasons beyond mortal understanding this is not a guarantee.

        We want the Shadowgate orange section clear so that the players swapping sides aren't decapitated as they swap during [Wrest](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=450191/wrest). The other orange section is meant to be a safe zone slow ranged players can expect to use pull to pull.

      </Callout>
      
      After the team lands, players should try to bait the Chamber Expeller's [Expulsion Beam](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=451600/expulsion-beam) to the sides of Shadowgate or the bridge.

    </TabsContent>

    <TabsContent value="2">
      <Image src={img_ansurek_mp2_w13_2} alt="Phase 2 Wrests 1 + 3 Part 2" />

      The beam will happen during [Wrest](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=450191/wrest), so once the beam has picked its direction, players should place themselves so that they are not gripped into the beam however they can best accomplish this. Don't place yourself directly in front of the Shadowgate or the bridge, as you will drop miasma where players will need to move to.

      This first Shadowgate assignments swap sides shortly before the first [Wrest](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=450191/wrest).

      <Callout type="info">

      As a rule of thumb, the Shadowgate users from here on out are waiting for, approximately, 4 seconds left on their Shadowgate cast. For one player, this means they will get the [Wrest](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=450191/wrest) lines and cancel it by going through the Shadowgate. The other player will go shortly before [Wrest](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=450191/wrest) finishes. Neither person will be gripped.

      As this happens, the other platform will be dealing with the second [Wrest](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=450191/wrest) cast. The goal of both platforms is now to kill the adds before the third [Wrest](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=450191/wrest) is cast. Remember that the Guardian and Expeller are sharing health with their counterparts on the other team's platform.

      <Callout type="error">

      It's one thing for the healers to not be able to save you to the damage from the [Wrest](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=450191/wrest), which means use a fucking personal, but getting gripped off the platform is a stupid, preventable mistake.

      - The first pair of Shadowgate users for this platform will be swapping shortly before Ansurek's [Wrest](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=450191/wrest) cast completes on the other platform.

The beam will pick a direction about 2/3rds of the way through the [Wrest](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=450191/wrest) cast, requiring potentially more on-the-fly movement from players compared to the other platform.

      [Gloom Touch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=464056/gloom-touch) is removed quickly, and everyone focuses on killing the adds before the other platform gets the third [Wrest](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=450191/wrest).
    </TabsContent>
  </div>
</Tabs>

The Shadowgate timings from pictures aren't the most helpful. Just remember that if your platform is getting [Wrest](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=450191/wrest) and you're next for the Shadowgate, you want to position yourself to use the gate during the cast. To keep it safe, halfway into the cast so you're not gripped away from the Shadowgate is a safe time to use it. However, if your platform is not getting the current [Wrest](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=450191/wrest) and you're next for the Shadowgate, look for Ansurek's cast bar and jump over a couple seconds before the cast finishes.

### Platform 2

The second platform is what distinguish the sides as `melee` and `ranged` as different adds spawn on each side in Mythic.

- Each side has the following two mobs:
  - A Chamber Expeller, the mob with [Expulsion Beam](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=451600/expulsion-beam) from the previous platform. These are the only mobs that share health across the two sides.
  - A Devoted Worshipper, the mob seen in heroic with 1 health and the [Worshipper's Protection](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=448488/worshippers-protection) shield that we have to break before their cast finishes.
  - Technically, both playforms still see a third mob, the Caustic Skitterer. Don't get aggro on these before the tank does (it's a heroic mechanic).
- The melee side has a single other mob, the Chamber Guardian. This is the tanked mob seen on the previous platform. Since it has no partner, it doesn't share health with anything.
- The ranged side has a new mythic spider friend, the <Sparkles>Chamber Acolyte</Sparkles>, of which two spawn on the left and right sides hanging a few yards off the edge of the platform. They are not reachable by melee, aside from something like a [Throw Glaive](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=185123/throw-glaive) or [Crackling Jade Lightning](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=117952/crackling-jade-lightning) for debuff purposes. They also spam a 10 second cast, [Dark Detonation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=455374/dark-detonation) that will kill everyone on the ranged side if it goes off. 

The [Shadowgate](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=460369/shadowgate) and [Wrest](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=450191/wrest) dynamic is the same as the first platform, however, the side in which someone physically reaches the platform first gets the first [Wrest](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=450191/wrest). In earlier progression it was possible to get a third [Wrest](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=450191/wrest) on the second platform, but this is now much less likely. However, because of this the recommendation was for a melee, likely a <Warrior/>, to leap up to the second platform early so the melee side can get the first [Wrest](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=450191/wrest) every time.

It's still beneficial for us to pick a side to get the first [Wrest](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=450191/wrest) every time, but this is more for making cooldown timings static.

      <Callout type="info">
        I didn't put text on these images because the second platform is more, "deal with the mechanics," rather than a step-by-step procedure more appropriate to a RaidPlan. This is more pictoral since the locations these adds and Shadowgate spawn in are the same for both platforms.
      </Callout>

      - The first mechanic on the second platform is the [Gloom Touch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=464056/gloom-touch). It takes a few seconds for the Devoted Worshipper to smell that healers are on the platform, but once it does the healers should already be towards the back left edge to dispel themselves immediately (holding hands, unsure of who it may be).
      - The Chamber Expellers jump to the left of the Worshipper, making the only worthwhile bait position to be on the left side of the platform. Everyone should try to remain to the left of the triangle at the bottom of the platform picture.
      - Lastly, [Dark Detonation](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=455374/dark-detonation) is spam-cast by the Acolytes while they're alive. They will be marked (one way or another), and we will use the Interrupt Anchor WeakAura to keep them kicked.
    </TabsContent>
    <TabsContent value="2">
      <Image src={img_ansurek_mp2_p2_2} alt="Phase 2 Part 2" />

      There are 3 generally valid locations for players to be for [Wrest](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=450191/wrest):
      1. At the back of the room, wherever is unimportant. This is good for mobile ranged, healers, ...etc.
      2. In the middle of the room, but not in the way of the Shadowgate or web bridge.
      3. At the top edge of the platform beyond the adds. This is good for melee that can negate the grip, like <Monk>Monks</Monk>, or <DeathKnight>Death Knights</DeathKnight>.

      The Shadowgate dance will happen during both [Wrests](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=450191/wrest). As a reminder, if your side is getting gripped you want to step through the gate about halfway through the cast, or at about 2 seconds before the cast finishes if your side is not getting gripped.

      [Gloom Touch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=464056/gloom-touch) from the Shadowgate can be dispelled off to the side for the first one. The second one can be dispelled on the Shadowgate itself. It shouldn't scare you to sit in the Shadowgate after coming through as you can't be sent back for 30 seconds and the gate itself won't hurt you. It is never a bad idea to call that you're ready for the dispel, regardless of platform.

      <Callout type="info">

      The only reason I don't recommend dispelling the second [Gloom Touch](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=464056/gloom-touch) on top of the Shadowgate for the other platforms is the Shadowgate is a visual mass of purple and red and seeing players in it is a shitshow. In a world where players reliably called out when they're ready for a dispel this might not be a problem, but we raid in a progression bracket where healers have to physically turn around to look at debuffed players to see if they're ready for a dispel, otherwise they'd sit in it silently until they died. Anyway, on this platform you can easily be boxed in between web miasma or run forward and  risk the healers dispelling you right in front of the bridge.

### Platform 3

<Image src={img_ansurek_mp2_p3_1} alt="Phase 2 Platform 3" />

The last platform is just like the start of phase 2 when we're still on the phase 1 platform. We deal with a lone Ascended Voidspeaker, kicking their [Shadowblast](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=447950/shadowblast) with WeakAura assignments while ranged stay away from melee since they'll spawn [Gloom Orbs](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=448176/gloom-orbs).


<Callout type="warning">

It's not a good idea for tanks to drag the Voidspeakers towards the edge of the platform. It's better for them to remain in the middle of the platform so ranged can easily spread around it and the melee. The knockback is equally potent within its 45 yard range.
