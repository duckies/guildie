The first phase revolves around space management and being consistent with the bombs. In your own personal preparation be weary of pre-nerf materials, as phase one changes were significant.

## Mechanics

These are the mechanics that are changed or worth commenting on in mythic.

### Phase 1 Mechanics

<Mechanic id="437592" name="Reactive Toxin" caption="Sets 2 and 3 spawn 3 bombs instead of 2.">
The major change to Phase 1, the 2nd and 3rd set of Reactive Toxin goes out 3 players, spawning 3 [Reactive Froth](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=438846) bombs instead of 2. Be weary of looking at old preparation materials for this fight as the third set used to have 4 bombs (2-3-4), post-nerf it’s 2-3-3.
</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id="460133" name="Toxic Reaction" caption="Bomb popping must be staggered.">
When a [Reactive Froth](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=438846) bomb is popped everyone is given a 2000% vulnerability to this mechanic for 1 second, requiring bomb popping to be staggered. 
</Mechanic>

<Mechanic id="439814" name="Silken Tomb" caption="Roots need to be cleared as fast as possible.">

The roots are mechanically the same as on heroic. However, most mechanics in phase one happen every 5 seconds, and often with sensitive positioning urging us to clear them as fast as possible. Players will self-clear wherever possible and things like Master’s Call will be assigned to help those in need. A small number of roots will need to be cleaved down each set (they have 18 million health).

There is utility in <Monk>Monks</Monk>, <Paladin>Holy Paladins</Paladin>, <Priest>Priest</Priest>, and <Rogue>Rogues</Rogue> being Gnomes so they can self-clear with the [Escape Artist](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=20589/escape-artist) racial. This gives Priests and Rogues more self-clearing capabilities, whereas Holy Paladins and Monks can use their racial to self clear then Freedom or Tiger’s Lust someone else.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2">
  <div>
    Those who cannot always clear themselves:

    - **<DemonHunter/>** can use their pre-meta jump to immune the root, however it’s not worth messing up their cd timings. It’s common for DHs to be under the boss to cleave away their root every set.
    - **<Priest>Priests</Priest>**
        - **Holy** needs help every time.
        - **Discipline** is currently a dead spec.
        - **Shadow** can disperse one, or two with a talent. However, this talent is on a choice node with [Mental Fortitude](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=194018/mental-fortitude) and shouldn’t be taken unless strictly necessary.
    - **<Evoker>Augmentation Evoker</Evoker>**
    Can only clear themselves once.
    - **<Rogue>Rogues</Rogue>** will need help on one of the roots unless taking double vanish, which is a decent DPS loss depending on the spec.
  </div>
  <div>

    | Iteration | Timing |
    | --- | --- |
| Silken Tomb 1	| 0:16  |
| Silken Tomb 2	| 0:56 (+40 Seconds) |
| Silken Tomb 3	| 1:50 (+54 Seconds) |

    The only class which requires Time Spiral is <Shaman>Shamans</Shaman> [Spirit Walk](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=58875/spirit-walk) is a 1 minute cooldown), therefore the only necessary Time Spiral is on Silken Tomb 2.

    #### The fuck does Time Spiral do?
    
    [Time Spiral](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=374968/time-spiral) is a 2-minute evoker talent that does the following when cast for 10 seconds:
    
    - Allows everyone within 40 yards to use their “major movement ability” even if it is on cooldown.
    - Using one’s “major movement ability” in this window will not incur a cooldown.

## Phase 1 • A Queen's Venom
The [Phase 1 RaidPlan](https://raidplan.io/plan/X4iPdCthlYOmlR5R) has been rotated so that it lines up with how movement is seen in log replays. The biggest concerns of this phase are being out of position for the fast-paced mechanics.

    <TabsContent value="part1">
      <Image src={img_ansurek_mp1_1} alt="Phase 1 Part 1" />

      The fight is started with the boss brought to the tip immediately to the right if you were running onto the platform. Everyone will stack on her to keep acid pools as close together as possible, just as on heroic.
    </TabsContent>
    <TabsContent value="part2">
      <Image src={img_ansurek_mp1_2} alt="Phase 1 Part 2" />

      Roots are placed as closely as possible to any preceding acid, but avoid crossing into the trapezoid on the other side of the red line as we want to keep this area clean for the intermission.

      - If you have assigned utility like Freedom, Tiger’s Lust, or Master’s Call on another player, their raid frame will glow thanks to the MRT note.
      - Tanks or those with immunities can dip into the acid before removing their root to save space.
    </TabsContent>
    <TabsContent value="part3">
      <Image src={img_ansurek_mp1_3} alt="Phase 1 Part 3" />

      During [Web Blades](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=439299/web-blades) melee will stack with the active tank in front of the boss near the edge and ranged loosely spread on the other side of the boss. Avoid being ahead of the group.

      - The [Web Blades](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=439299/web-blades) will spawn every 0.5 seconds until 3 are spawned, after which there is a 1-second delay before they erupt every 0.5 seconds in the same order they spawned in.
      - Everyone will refer to the WeakAura on their screen and wait to move until the last blade spawns (the last green tick), or at the least stagger movement as a cohesive unit. We want to avoid someone running 20 yards ahead of the group and cutting everyone off if they are targeted.
      
      <Image src={ansurek_mp1_blades} alt="Phase 1 Blades WeakAura" className="mx-auto" />
    </TabsContent>
    <TabsContent value="part4">
      <Image src={img_ansurek_mp1_4} alt="Phase 1 Part 4" />

      The first set of [Reactive Toxin](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=437592/reactive-toxin) goes out on 2 players and spawns 2 [Reactive Froth](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=438846) bombs.

      - A WeakAura will assign players with [Reactive Toxin](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=437592/reactive-toxin) to spawn their bomb on <Star /> (stack 1) or <Circle /> (stack 2). Consider the following when placing these bombs:
      - There will not be world markers for this set.
      - There must be enough room between these bomb circles for the raid to stack between.
      - The bomb circles should be touching the web miasma to save space, but no further. If the bomb is half in the web miasma and the boss is too close to the melee stack, melee players can get hit by the wave since they cannot back away from her.
    </TabsContent>
    <TabsContent value="part5">
      <Image src={img_ansurek_mp1_5} alt="Phase 1 Part 5" />

      If the <Star /> and <Circle /> markers are placed correctly there will be a cubbie between the two. If there isn't, the raid can stack just outside of their intersection.
    </TabsContent>
    <TabsContent value="part6">
      <Image src={img_ansurek_mp1_6} alt="Phase 1 Part 6" />

      If necessary, you can cheat into the middle of the room. Only cheat ahead if it prevents you from being killed. Remember, immunities (that don't prevent you from dropping webs) should be used during webs so that you may dip into the acid and save room for the rest of the group.
    </TabsContent>
    <TabsContent value="part7">
      <Image src={img_ansurek_mp1_7} alt="Phase 1 Part 7" />

      This starts a sequence of 2 back-to-back [Web Blades](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=439299/web-blades). This image depicts the first blades, and nothing about them is different from the first time we've done them. Reminder of web blade mechanics:
      - Melee are in front of the boss with the tanks.
      - Ranged are loosely spread opposite of the melee group, behind the boss.
      - Don't move until the WeakAura shows the third blade has spawned.
      - Dodge in the same direction as your group. Otherwise, you can be out of position for the next mechanic.

      However, once we finish dodging everyone should remain in position to bait the next set of [Web Blades](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=439299/web-blades) away from where we just came from.
    </TabsContent>
    <TabsContent value="part8">
      <Image src={img_ansurek_mp1_8} alt="Phase 1 Part 8" />

      After the first [Web Blades](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=439299/web-blades) are spawned, and we've waited where we've dodged to, we will spawn a second set. We dodge these [Web Blades](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=439299/web-blades) by still listening to the WeakAura, but back towards the wall of web miasma.

      As we are running back, the boss will spawn the 2nd set of [Reactive Toxin](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=437592/reactive-toxin) debuffs. 
    </TabsContent>
    <TabsContent value="part9">
      <Image src={img_ansurek_mp1_9} alt="Phase 1 Part 9" />

      The second set of [Reactive Toxin](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=437592/reactive-toxin) goes on 3 players instead of 2. To deal with this we will place them in a line with the radius of each debuff touching the miasma from the webs. Avoid overlapping the radius of the <Star /> debuff with the web miasma. If melee are too close to the boss and need to backup they can use the full size of the bomb.
      > Unlike the first set, sets of 3 toxin debuffs do not need to have a space between them.
    
      The <Diamond/> popper needs to be careful to follow the `DON'T POP` WeakAura, not the assignment WeakAura as that is an estimate. The <Diamond/> popper must always pop the moment the vulnerability falls off from <Circle/>.

      This is the *difficult* dance of the phase. The following happens in quick succession:
      
      1. `1:35` — (Prior Slide) The [Reactive Froth](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=438846) bombs have finished exploding.
      2. `1:38` — [Web Blades](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=439299/web-blades) spawn. Since we have too little time to reconvene back at the bomb miasma, we instead dodge towards the opposite side of this platform section.
      3. `1:40` — The moment we can dodge the blades coincides with [Liquefy](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=436799/liquefy) puddles. So the ranged and melee groups should move into a safe position after the third blade spawns, then stack together for Liquefy.

      Some level of mess is acceptable here in the name of safety, but avoid crossing into the next section of room. You may cheat into the middle of the room, or behind us, if you wish.
    </TabsContent>
    <TabsContent value="part11">
      <Image src={img_ansurek_mp1_11} alt="Phase 1 Part 11" />
      After a short break from the previous mechanic set we have [Silken Tomb](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=439814/silken-tomb) roots. Then, as we're dodging with our melee and ranged groups, we get [Web Blades](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=439299/web-blades). We dodge towards the next secton of the room.
    </TabsContent>
    <TabsContent value="part12">
      <Image src={img_ansurek_mp1_12} alt="Phase 1 Part 12" />
      The last overlap of the phase is [Web Blades](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=439299/web-blades) at `2:20` followed by the [Reactive Froth](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=438846) bomb-popping sequence starting at `2:23`. This is most difficult for the <Star/> group, but other players should be trying to dodge these blades towards their assigned bomb positions.

This Stankie video is a good high-level overview of the fight.

Dratnos explains well the reasonings behind certain setups, issues that may arrise, and tank specific positioning. Beware that this is a pre-nerf video, but he discusses this in a pinned comment.

A Fury Warrior pov video from Northern Sky's kill. This is pre-nerf, but it's not visually cluttered and they are the patrons of our WeakAura pack, and therefore, we mimic their core strategies.
